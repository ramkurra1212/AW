### Washing Machine Application

The task is to design and implement a backend service to control an appliance such as a wash machine. The API should be REST
based and the state of the appliance should be persisted to any form of persistent storage. 

The project should be implemented using Java. Feel free to use any 3rd party library that you are comfortable with. Unit tests are
expected and the assignment will be assessed based on good programming practices and design.
